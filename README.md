# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)

Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this homework assignment, you will need to:

Preprocess the raw data
Tune the models
Compare two or more models

REPORTING

The forest model yielded better results than using the SVM model. It recorded a slightly higher accuracy with or without GridSearchCV.
With an accuracy of 90%, the forest model is an excellent predictor of new exoplanets. However,a model leveraging deep learning techniques may prove superior.
